# What I wish to accomplish this semester is:

* Understanding the fundamental ideas behind _pattern finding and clustering_ in text analytics, visualization, and data mining.
* Be familiar with the main mining algorithms for structured and unstructured text data.
* Be able to apply this knowledge in the real world.
